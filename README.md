<h1 align="center">Hi 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">A versatile Software Engineering student and technology enthusiast from Turkey</h3>
<p align="center">
Hi there, I'm Cem Aksoy! My passion for technology began with simple fixes around the house, but over time, it evolved into a full-fledged commitment to learning, creating, and improving.  

As a Software Engineering student at Bahçeşehir University, I constantly explore the world of technology, from coding to project management. I'm proficient in tools and technologies such as <b>SQL</b>, <b>Tableau</b>, and <b>Power BI</b>, which I use to analyze data and drive decision-making. Alongside, I've also gained hands-on experience in programming with <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>Flutter</b>, allowing me to craft efficient and impactful solutions.  

My journey isn't limited to just coding—I’m equally passionate about understanding the bigger picture. With a strong interest in <b>project management</b>, <b>software development</b>, and <b>entrepreneurship</b>, I aim to contribute to meaningful projects that blend innovation with purpose.  

I believe in lifelong learning and the power of collaboration. Whether it's analyzing data, developing software, or leading a project, I'm driven by the desire to make a positive impact. As I navigate through this exciting career path, I look forward to embracing challenges and crafting solutions that matter.
